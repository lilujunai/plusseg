## Introduction
<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="./src/images/plusseg_logo_square.png">

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher

plusseg is an open source image semantic segmentation toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the plus project developed by [ShanghaiTech PLUS Lab](http://plus.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn)

## Major Features
- **Modular Design**

- **Multiple Frameworks**

- **High Efficiency**

- **State-of-the-art Performance**

We have implemented several semantic segmentation algorithms in PyTorch with comparable performance
Code will be updated in Oct.
